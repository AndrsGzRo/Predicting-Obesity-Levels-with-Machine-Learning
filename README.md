# Predicting-Obesity-Levels-with-Machine-Learning
A Data Science Project Using UCIâ€™s Lifestyle and Eating Habits Dataset.

## Overview 
This project explores how eating, habits, physical activity, and lifestyle choices influece obesity leves. Using the **UCI "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition** dataset, I will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance evaluation, and machine learning classification to identify the main factores that contribute to obesity.

## Objectives
1. **Indentify the main factores associated with obesity levels.**
2. **Develop a predictive model** capable of classifying individuals into obesity categories.
3. **Evaluate the influence of eating and exercise habits** using feature importance techniques.
4. **Visualize relationships** between lifestyle variables and obesity levels.
